This repo contains my notes of coding using OpenCV lib, which is refered to a Book named <**OpenCV轻松入门**>. The book can be bought online, linke. 
Also, you can visit the official web.

## Test Environment
These codes have been tested under the environment listed bellow:
1. Ubuntu18/20
2. Python3.x
3. Anaconda
4. OpenCV 3.4.3.18 (other versions may work as well)

## Raw Chapter Codes
Refer to the book, each chapter has some codes for practice. So I collect each chapter's codes toghter, and also wrote some sample script for tests.

## Jupyter Notebooks
For users who want to practice online using jupyter notebook to have a direct understanding of output results, you can try use these notebooks, I integrated all codes into different demos. Each demo stands for different functionalities in OpenCV lib. 

## Images
All relevant images whcih will be used in chapter codes, you can add your own media resource when runing these codes.
